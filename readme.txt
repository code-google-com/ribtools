This project's goal is to parse and to some extent render RenderMan RIB files.

The test files are taken from the RenSH project by Ian Stephenson (http://www.dctsystems.co.uk/RenderMan/rensh.html).
I'm not sure about the original authors for those files.

The project is currently hosted over at http://code.google.com/p/ribtools/

Specific reference material:
- Production Rendering ( http://books.google.com/books?id=krTfLA5b940C )
- The RenderMan Companion ( http://books.google.com/books?id=jXr9CFO8GK8C&pgis=1 )
- The RISpec ( https://renderman.pixar.com/products/rispec/index.htm )
