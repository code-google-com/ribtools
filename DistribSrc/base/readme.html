<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>RibTools is a hobby project developed by me (Davide Pasca).<br>
The project's main goal is to write RibRender, a RenderMan-compliant-wannabe
renderer.<br>
The focus of RibRender is towards speed and high scalability, it
aims to achieve this by utilizing parallelism at all levels:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Instruction level parallelism (Adaptive N-way SIMD)
 <li>Many-cores hardware (Currently OpenMP)
 <li>Per-bucket (same-frame) network-distributed rendering (Custom protocol over TCP/IP)
</ul>
<p>Please notice that this project is still in a very early phase. It will only process selected .rib files and the rendering quality is very poor at best.<br>
Nothing malicious comes with the executables included but, nonetheless, I cannot be held responsible for any direct or indirect damage that may derive from anything related to this project.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Launch the file <code>MakeTests.bat</code>, wait for it to complete and enjoy some fine renderings in the newly created <code>TestsOutput</code> folder.<br>
<b>Notice</b> that you may need to perform a one-time install of the freely redistributable CRT libraries from Microsoft. Out of convenience, the installation is included with this package and it's at <code>Install\vcredist_x86.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Three executables are currently distributed: <b>RibRenderTool</b>, <b>RibRenderFile</b> and <b>RSLCompilerCmd</b>.</p>
<h4>RibRenderTool</h4>
<p>This is a minimally interactive application that will render any .rib file present in the 'TestScenes' folder.<br>
Launch the application, right click in the window to open a menu from which to choose a .rib file to render.</p>
<h4>RibRenderFile</h4>
<p>This command will render a .rib file in input to a JPEG file in output. It can also work as a rendering server for network distributed rendering.<br>
For usage instructions, type <code>RibRenderFile -help</code></p>
<h4>RSLCompilerCmd</h4>
<p>This command is included only for <i>internal testing purposes</i>.<br>
It compiles a .sl file into a RibRender .rrasm file type. Such operation is done internally by the renderer, and the user doesn't normally need to run this command explicitly.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>
<strong>...for programmers...</strong>
<ul>
<li>Use the build.bat script to copy all data files in place (from the dir <code>DistribSrc</code> to <code>Distrib</code>)
<li>Open the solution <code>pc\RibRender.sln</code> with <i>Visual Studio</i> and compile from there to get the executables
</ul>

<h3>Additional Credits</h3>
RibTools includes code from the following libraries:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ijg.org">JPEG library</a>
<li><a href="http://freeglut.sourceforge.net">freeglut</a>
</ul>
<p>Sample files were found on the Internet and are assumed to be
freely redistributable. For any issues in that regard, please
contact me personally and I'll be happy to give due credit or
remove whatever eventual material 8)</p>
<p>Most of the included RIB files are old samples that I found
included in the <a href="http://www.dctsystems.co.uk/RenderMan/rensh.html">RenSH project</a>.<br>
The "Sponza Atrium" model is originally from Marko Dabrovic. The
RIB version was taken from the <a href="http://lucille.sourceforge.net">lucille renderer</a>
